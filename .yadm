Windows settings: # Only obscure things
- Switch the fn - ctrl
- Remap Caps Lock with backspace
- Use a customized keyboard layout (English alt-gr with dead keys)
   For this I followed this instructions: 
     - https://superuser.com/questions/1133440/us-international-without-dead-keys-layout-windows-10
     - which leads to this repository: https://github.com/thomasfaingnaert/win-us-intl-altgr
     - after installation, it got permanently activated with:
     Settings > Typing settings > (at the bottom of the screen) Advanced Keyboard settings 
       > Override for default input settings > Select you custom keyboard from the menu
